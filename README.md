# Sephora Beauty Recommender 

https://beautyrecommender.streamlit.app/

Sephora stands out as a leading e-commerce platform, globally renowned for its vast selection of high-quality cosmetics and beauty products. The platform offers a diverse range of items, including skincare, makeup, hair care, and perfumes from reputable brands. Navigating through numerous options, product complexity, limited information, and slow search speed poses challenges for customers. To address these issues, the development of a product recommendation system becomes crucial. Such a system aims to enhance the shopping experience, provide tailored suggestions, and boost overall sales.

The primary objective is to offer customers personalized product recommendations based on their preferences and characteristics.
The project employs three distinct approaches: 

**Fav Finder - Popularity Based Algorithm:**
Fav Finder employs a popularity-based algorithm to recommend products. It prioritizes items based on their overall popularity, often measured by factors such as user ratings, likes, or sales counts. This approach suggests products that have gained significant attention or positive feedback from a broad user base.

**Trait Picker - Content-Based Filtering Algorithm:**
Trait Picker utilizes a content-based filtering algorithm for product recommendations. This approach involves analyzing the inherent characteristics and features of products. In Trait Picker, the system recommends items by considering specific traits, such as brand, category, or ingredients, aligning with user preferences derived from their previous choices or stated traits.

**Squad Suggester - Collaborative Filtering Algorithm:**
Squad Suggester employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to provide personalized recommendations. This method identifies patterns of similarity between users based on their past behavior, preferences, or ratings. Squad Suggester recommends products that align with the preferences of users who share similar tastes, enhancing the chances of user satisfaction.
